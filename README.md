# This is an alt
Hi,

This is the alternate account of [cyrus01337](https://github.com/cyrus01337) that exists solely for emergency cases, like if I exhaust my Github pipeline limit and need to (sometimes urgently) deploy an application. Other inquiries can be taken up on the main account, and if you PR my only repo I'll eat you (real) (not scripted) (I don't know how I got here).
